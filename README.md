This is a tutorial by Florin Pop and Brad Traversy from a Udemy course. It is a simple container app that gives you three options: Good, Cheap, and Fast. If you click on the first option, which is 'Good', everything works. If you click on the second option, which is 'Cheap', everything works still (both are selectable).
Once you try to click a third option, 'Fast', it un-selects one of the other selections, making sure you can never have more than two options selected at one time.
